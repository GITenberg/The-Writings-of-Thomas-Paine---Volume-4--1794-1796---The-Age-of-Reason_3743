description: "The Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology\
  \ is an influential work written by English and American political activist Thomas\
  \ Paine. It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges\
  \ institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. Originally distributed\
  \ as unbound pamphlets, it was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807.\
  \ It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic\
  \ revival. British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as\
  \ a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. The Age of\
  \ Reason presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine\
  \ saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire\
  \ political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him\
  \ to reject miracles and to view the Bible as \"an ordinary piece of literature\
  \ rather than as a divinely inspired text\". It promotes natural religion and argues\
  \ for the existence of a creator-God.\nMost of Paine's arguments had long been available\
  \ to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style,\
  \ he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. The book was also inexpensive,\
  \ putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers. Fearing the spread of\
  \ what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted\
  \ printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless,\
  \ Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
